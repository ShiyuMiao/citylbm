# CityLBM

CityLBM is an academic, design-oriented urban wind field simulation
and risk identification system based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).

The system is developed as part of doctoral research in urban and architectural studies.

## Project Status
CityLBM is under active academic development.
The repository currently serves as a reference point for the project
and will be progressively updated.

## AIJ Case E v0.4.0 Release Gate

The active Experiment 2 branch is preparing CityLBM v0.4.0 around AIJ Case E
`ac+N` validation. Formal validation is locked to the official z=2 m probe
set: `RS_caseE.csv` filtered by `case=ac` and `Wind_direction=N` gives 80
probes. Diagnostic height offsets such as `z_plus_half` or `z+4.5 m` are not
accepted as formal validation results.

Current newly-run native results do not satisfy the formal accuracy gate. The
best run so far is dx=2 m, 48000 steps, spinup 12000, raw_trilinear sampling:
MAE 31.436 percentage points, R2 -4.006626, Pearson -0.001683. These results
support a limitations/diagnostic discussion only, not a predictive-accuracy
claim or a formal `v0.4.0` release.

Current Case E materials:

- `docs/experiments/casee/data_manifest.csv`
- `docs/experiments/casee/casee_preset.json`
- `docs/experiments/casee/casee_protocol.md`
- `docs/experiments/casee/tools/casee_audit.py`
- `docs/experiments/casee/tools/generate_native_casee.py`
- `docs/experiments/casee/tools/release_gate.py`
- `docs/experiments/casee/results/casee_native_metric_comparison.csv`
- `docs/releases/v0.4.0-rc1.md`

Run the audit after official data are present:

```powershell
python docs/experiments/casee/tools/casee_audit.py --release-target v0.4.0
python docs/experiments/casee/tools/release_gate.py
```

If a complete solver output exists, provide a CSV with 80 probe predictions:

```powershell
python docs/experiments/casee/tools/casee_audit.py --release-target v0.4.0 --predicted path\to\casee_probe_time_mean.csv
```

The release gate fails closed unless CityLBM builds, the new GHA is loaded in
Rhino/Grasshopper, native FluidX3D dx=3 m and dx=2 m official z=2 m runs
complete, MAE improves clearly below the previous ~20 percentage-point level,
R2 and Pearson are positive, Case A smoke regression passes, and all metrics
trace to command/log/CSV/figure artifacts.

## Research Experiment Archive

The v0.2.0 package includes a validation/application evidence archive under
`releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/`:

- `AIJ_CaseA/`: benchmark validation support.
- `AIJ_CaseE/`: benchmark validation support.
- `Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/`: real digital-twin
  urban wind-environment design-application experiment.

In the paper structure, AIJ Case A and AIJ Case E support the workflow and
solver validation layer, while Experiment 3 evaluates how TUM2TWIN digital-twin
urban data can be transformed into CFD-ready geometry, simulated with FluidX3D,
reviewed with ParaView/Rhino, and interpreted through basic building-morphology
parameters.

The current Experiment 3 SCI section draft and verification package are stored
under `academic-paper-writer/paper-drafts/`, with release copies under
`releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/`.

The latest Experiment 3 submission-readiness layer adds figure/table captions,
asset-level evidence checks, and a reviewer-facing readiness audit:

- `academic-paper-writer/paper-drafts/figure_table_captions.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/experiment3_sci_figure_captions_zh.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/experiment3_sci_table_captions_zh.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/reports/experiment3_submission_readiness_audit.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/manifests/experiment3_submission_readiness_checklist.csv`

The newest statistical addendum adds effect-size and uncertainty evidence for
the Experiment 3 conclusions:

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/reports/experiment3_effect_size_uncertainty_analysis.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/figures/experiment3_effect_size_uncertainty_summary.csv`

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/experiment3_effect_size_uncertainty_results_zh.md`

The directional-mechanism addendum further explains whether the wind response
is caused by a single inflow direction or by the campus block morphology:

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/reports/experiment3_directional_anisotropy_analysis.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/figures/experiment3_directional_anisotropy_summary.csv`

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/experiment3_directional_anisotropy_results_zh.md`

The morphology stage-transition addendum separates near-facade shelter,
20-50 m recovery, and directional reactivity for the 101 retained building
components:

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/reports/morphology_stage_transition_analysis.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/figures/morphology_stage_transition_panel.png`

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/morphology_stage_transition_conclusion_en.md`

The morphology directional-fingerprint addendum links 20-50 m local-context
wind-sector response to basic morphology descriptors and stage-transition
classes:

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/reports/morphology_directional_fingerprint_analysis.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/figures/morphology_directional_fingerprint_panel.png`

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/morphology_directional_fingerprint_conclusion_zh.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/morphology_directional_fingerprint_conclusion_en.md`

The reviewer reproducibility layer maps Experiment 3 claims to evidence type,
source artifact, reviewer risk, and safe response language:

- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/reports/experiment3_reviewer_reproducibility_and_claim_audit.md`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/manifests/experiment3_reviewer_claim_risk_matrix.csv`
- `releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/experiment3_reviewer_response_paragraphs_en.md`

The final Experiment 3 completeness layer consolidates the data, figures,
evidence boundaries, claim readiness, and remaining gaps for manuscript use:
