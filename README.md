# CityLBM

CityLBM is an academic, design-oriented urban wind field simulation
and risk identification system based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).

The system is developed as part of doctoral research in urban and architectural studies.

## Project Status
CityLBM is under active academic development.
The repository currently serves as a reference point for the project
and will be progressively updated.

## Research Experiment Archive

The v0.2.0 package includes a validation/application evidence archive under
`releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/`:

- `AIJ_CaseA/`: benchmark validation support.
- `AIJ_CaseE/`: benchmark validation support.
- `Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/`: real digital-twin
  urban wind-environment design-application experiment.

In the paper structure, AIJ Case A and AIJ Case E support the workflow and
solver validation layer, while Experiment 3 evaluates how TUM2TWIN digital-twin
urban data can be transformed into CFD-ready geometry, simulated with FluidX3D,
reviewed with ParaView/Rhino, and interpreted through basic building-morphology
parameters.

The current Experiment 3 SCI section draft and verification package are stored
under `academic-paper-writer/paper-drafts/`, with release copies under
`releases/v0.2.0/package/validation_experiments/Experiment3_TUM2TWIN_DigitalTwin_DesignApplication/paper_text/`.
