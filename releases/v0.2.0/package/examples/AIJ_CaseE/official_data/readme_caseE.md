## Overview

This dataset contains wind tunnel measurement results from a real urban district in Niigata City, Japan, featuring a dense layout of low-rise two-story buildings. The experiments represent both pre- and post-construction conditions of a 60 m high-rise (Building A) and two 18 m mid-rise buildings (Buildings B and C). The model was scaled at 1:250, and wind conditions were measured at pedestrian height.
